# Algorithms & Data structures Collection

### Description

A small collection of various algorithms and data structures. The implemented data structures are: `Linked List`, `Queue`, `Heap`, `Directed Graph`
, `Binary Search Tree`, `Hashtable` and `Sorted String Table (SSTable)`, while the list of implemented algorithms is:

* `Sorting algorithms` (Bubble, Merge and Quick)
* `Search algorithms` (Binary and Interpolation)
* `Graph algorithms` (Best first search, uniform cost search, maze path search)
* `Math algorithms` (Square root, catalan number)
* `Bit Manipulation algorithms`

The source code is written in Java 8 and Maven is used as build management tool. The unit tests are written in JUnit. The project tech stack is:

```
  Java SE      8
  Maven        3.5.4
  JUnit        4.11
```

### Building & running the project

The following command compiles the project and runs the unit tests:

```
mvn clean install
```

The unit tests can be executed separately with the following command:

```
mvn clean test
```
